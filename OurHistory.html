                <div class="content">OUR HISTORY
In 1979, Stephen Gordon, was restoring his Queen Anne Victorian home in Eureka, California. After spending endless days tracking down missing bits and pieces of authentic period hardware, lighting fixtures and finishes, Stephen found there were a lot of people with the same problem. He sensed a need in the marketplace, brought his vision to life, and opened the first Restoration Hardware store in Eureka, California in 1980.
Restoration Hardware had 47 stores when we first went public in 1998. Shortly thereafter, we underwent a rapid expansion that doubled the number of stores in just three years. However, with a tough economy from 1998 to 2001 Restoration Hardware closed some of its locations, including the original store in Old Town Eureka.
In 2001, Gary Friedman joined Restoration Hardware to become our Chairman and CEO. Under Gary’s visionary leadership, Restoration Hardware experienced a complete transformation. In September 2010, we shifted the focus, changed our name to RH and began our evolution into a luxury brand. Stores were redesigned to become “galleries,” indicating a complete re-conceptualization of the shopping experience. RH created a different model, partnering with gifted artisans from around the globe. Gary said, “We are more curators than we are retailers. We find artists we love and ‘curate’ that person. We source the world.”
From 2010 until now, our business has evolved from operating inside mall locations with approximately 6,000 square feet of selling space to next generation design galleries with upwards of 70,000 square feet of selling space. We are building inspiring spaces that blur the lines between residential and retail, indoors and outdoors, physical and digital. Our product lines continue to expand, now including RH Teen and RH Modern. The Gallery at the Three Arts Club in Chicago is the first-of-its-kind retail concept that signifies the brand’s initial foray into hospitality—where we reimagine the retail experience with a restaurant and wine pairings to create a home-like atmosphere. RH focuses on a luxury customer experience, where the customer is delighted with every interaction. Our unique product development, go-to-market and supply-chain capabilities, together with our significant scale, give RH the ability to delight our customers. RH offers a compelling combination of design, quality and value that we believe is unparalleled in the marketplace.
As we continue to transform into the leading home brand for the luxury customer, we continue to innovate, push traditional boundaries and reinvent ourselves. We continue to fearlessly fight for what we believe in. We continue to delight our customers. We continue to show the naysayers that anything is possible.
We’re creating the most inspiring and productive luxury spaces in the history of our industry. It hasn’t happened overnight. It’s been years in the making. Years of curating the right people, the right products, and creating a customer experience that reflects our beliefs.
We’ve become a team of people who don’t know what can’t be done. A team of people who believe in leading versus following. A team of people who are not interested in best practices, but are passionate about next practices.
We will be forever unsatisfied and forever on the move. This is not a lifestyle—it is a love style.
