THESE ARE OUR VALUES. THEY GUIDE OUR BEHAVIOR AND ACT AS THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL OUR DECISIONS.
people
We believe deeply that the “right” people are our greatest asset. We value people with high energy, who possess the ability to energize others. People who are smart, creative and have a point of view. People who see the answer in every problem, versus those who see the problem in every answer. People who are driven, determined and won’t take “no” for an answer. We value team players, people who are more concerned with what’s right, rather than who’s right.
QUalITY
Quality starts with our people, and should be visible in every aspect of our company. From our people and products, to our service and standards, from the way we communicate to our commitment to educate. From the accuracy and efficiency in our distribution centers, to the marketing and presentation of our products in our galleries, source books and online. Being committed to quality means being able to see it in every detail of our organization.
servICe
We believe that service starts inside the organization and embrace a concept called “People First.” Simply put, it means “if we expect our people to deliver first class service to our customers, we must first deliver first class service to our people.” It is everyone’s responsibility to remove the obstacles, and provide support so our associates throughout the organization are empowered to “Do the Right Thing.” Our people smile when we smile, our people serve our customers when we serve our people.
INNovaTIoN
We value innovation, taking risks and boldly going where no company has gone before. We believe you’re either striving to get better, or allowing yourself to get worse—there is no such thing as staying the same. The power of innovation comes from leveraging the creative minds and spirit of all our people, at all levels of the organization. We strive to build an environment that encourages people to challenge, ask “why? ” and “why not? ” We embrace those people who have the courage to put forth new ideas and breathe new life into our company. Innovation is at the core of what we do.
